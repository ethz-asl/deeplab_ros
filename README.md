# ROS Wrapper for DeepLab

This is a package for using DeepLab models with ROS. DeepLab is a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture for semantic image segmentation, where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g., person, dog, cat and so on) to every pixel in the input image. For more information about DeepLab, please visit [this link](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab).

Code for running inference is based on the following [Colab notebook](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/deeplab/deeplab_demo.ipynb).
